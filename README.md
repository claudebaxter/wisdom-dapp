#Reach-wisdom-dapp-tutorial

This is a completed Reach tutorial from docs.reach.sh, you can view the tutorial page <a href=https://docs.reach.sh/tut/wfs/#wfs title="Wisdom For Sale Reach dApp Tutorial"> here.</a>

To program in Reach, you will need to follow the necessary Reach installation guidelines here <a href=https://docs.reach.sh/quickstart/ title="Reach Installation Guide"> here.</a> It requires the use of Docker, and for Windows you will need to also use WSL2. 

If you use VS Code, I recommend using Reach IDE extension to recognise the rsh filetype as javascript.
